         GAME_READY_TO_BEGIN, GAME_IN_PROGRESS, GAME_COMPLETE__FAIL and

          string each time, and I used this to inform  application with regards to what elements 
          should be visible, what functionalities should be actionable and so on. This is a simple 
         but effective way to handle game state and control the flow of the game.
